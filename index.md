# Otto - Smart Home Automation
Otto is an automation engine for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

![](otto/images/ha_logo_100px.png)

This is a general purpose automation engine that integrates with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), and provides higher fidelity automation rules and flexibility than Home Assistant's built-in automation capability.

There are two projects for Otto:
* `otto-engine`
  * [https://github.com/sheaffej/otto-engine](https://github.com/sheaffej/otto-engine)
  * Python rules engine using asyncio
* `otto-ui`
  * [https://github.com/sheaffej/otto-ui](https://github.com/sheaffej/otto-ui)
  * Angular 2+ Web UI for buiding and managing rules
